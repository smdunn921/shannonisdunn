            <h1>The Lonely Months Project</h1>
            <h2>On the Days When I Can't Think of Myself, I Think About You Instead</h2>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>The Lonely Months Project is a project for my Digital Storytelling 2 class (Spring 2022), in which I take poems I've written and turn them into visual poems. My goal was to have four poems posted by the end of the semester. The Lonely Months itself is a mental space— my mental space— where I have to dig myself back out of the empty hole in which I've found myself. Most of these poems are written about and for other times, places, and people, all of which and whom I find myself missing at any given moment.</p>
            <p>I'd like to note the contrast between this and my project for Digital Storytelling 1, which was titled <a href="https://shanisdunn.tumblr.com/">Beauty is Hidden All Around Us</a>. In that project, I tried to look for beauty in the small things. In this project, I am allowing myself the space for the sadness that comes with the realization that life sucks sometimes. Either way, isn't life wonderful in the way we are able to have these different perspectives? I am pursuing this new path to allow myself room to grow, both as a writer and as a human.</p>
            <p>If you hover over "The Lonely Months" section of the navigation bar at the top, you will be greeted with a dropdown menu. It will guide you along the journey to the different spaces. The videos, embedded from youtube, appear on the left, and the actual text of the poem is on the right. The videos also have an option for captions. Use these videos in whatever way you need— mentally (please do not steal my poems, audio or videos).</p>
            <p>I'm glad you've found yourself here, at least momentarily, though I hate to see you go.  Take this moment to breathe. It's okay to feel sad sometimes, especially about leaving. Goodbyes are always the hardest. Take care of yourself. Until we meet again.</p>
            <p>As a note, two of the poems have been taken offline because they are actively being reviewed as submissions to various publications. Autumn Mournings and Breakfast Thoughts appear in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pendulum-Literary-University-Pittsburgh-Greensburg/dp/B09WHCWX48/ref=sr_1_1crid=2O6OWFBP8IPST&keywords=pendulum+university+of+pittsburgh&qid=1676780711&sprefix=pendulum+university+of+pittsburgh%2Caps%2C104&sr=8-1">Pitt-Greensburg's Pendulum (Spring 2022)</a>.
