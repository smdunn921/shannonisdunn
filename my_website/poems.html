            The Lonely Months Project is an ongoing project for my Digital Storytelling 2 class, in which I take poems I've written and turn them into visual poems. My current goal is to have four by the end of the semester. The Lonely Months itself is a mental space– my mental space– for when I have to dig myself back out of the hole I've found myself in, sometimes with help, sometimes without. Most of these poems are written about and for other times, places, and people, all of which and whom I find myself missing at any given moment.

            I think it's especially fun to note the contrast between this and my project for Digital Storytelling 1, which was titled <a href="https://shanisdunn.tumblr.com/">Beauty is Hidden All Around Us</a>. In that project, I tried to look for beauty in the small things. In this project, I am allowing myself the space for the sadness that comes with the realization that life sucks sometimes. Either way, isn't life wonderful in the way we are able to have these different perspectives? I hope this new path I'm pursuing allows me room to grow, both as a writer and as a human.

            If you hover over "The Lonely Months" section of the nav bar at the top, you will be greetied with a dropdown menu. Tt will guide you along the journey to the different spaces. When completed, there will be a video there, with the actual text of the poem next to or maybe under it. We'll figure that out later. As stated, it's still a work in progress.

                I'm glad you've found yourself here, at least momentarily, though I hate to see you go. Take this moment to breathe. It's okay to feel sad sometimes, especially about leaving. If you'd like to stay secretly updated on my site development, the link to my Github for this site is below. The other parts aren't worked on quite as freely.
