                <strong><a href="http://teentitans.newtfire.org/">Teen Titans Project</a></strong><br/>Fall 2019 - Present (Hum 1030: Coding and Digital Archives &amp; <strong>Hum 1050: Coding and Data Visualization - IN PROGRESS</strong>)
                <p>In the Fall of 2019, Lauren McNeill and I started the Teen Titans project, where our goal was to mark up data and metadata of transcripts of the Teen Titans original series (2003) and the 1980's comic The New Teen Titans. We used XML to mark up both texts, then with the help of Dr. Elisa Beshero-Bondar and Alyssa Argento, I styled the website to be able to put up the texts in a certain section of it. This part of the project was lengthy because of how many episodes there were to go through; I ended up doing about half of those, whereas Lauren did the other half and the comic book markup of metadata. I was then able to take the information given in the episode XML files and output Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to show which characters spoke the most within any given episode. The episode files also allowed me to run Javascript to be able to toggle colors on and off where each of the Titans spoke within the transcripts. After organizing all of the work, we were able to run Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) to make transformations of the XML files. This allowed us to organize them up on the website to have the tv episodes with their corresponding comics on the same page.</p>
