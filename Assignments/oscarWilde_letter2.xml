<body><heading>My own Darling Boy,</heading>
I got your telegram <time unit="minutes" n="30">half an hour</time> ago, and just send a line to say that I feel that my only hope of again doing <adjective type="positive">beautiful</adjective> work in art is being with you. It was not so in the <adjective type="neutral">old</adjective> days, but now it is <adjective type="neutral">different</adjective>, and you can really recreate in me that energy and sense of <adjective type="positive">joyous</adjective> power on which art depends.
Everyone is <adjective type="negative">furious</adjective> with me for going back to you, but they don't understand us. I feel that it is only with you that I can do anything at all. Do remake my <adjective type="negative">ruined</adjective> life for me, and then our friendship and love will have a <adjective type="neutral">different</adjective> meaning to the world.
I wish that when we met at <location where="Rouen">Rouen</location> we had not parted at all. There are such <adjective type="neutral">wide</adjective> abysses now of space and land between us. But we love each other.</body>
<closing><valediction>Goodnight, dear. Ever yours</valediction>,
Oscar</closing>
