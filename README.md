trying to make things seem cool (because they totally are); this is the place you can come to see the magic happen! welcome!

I hope you're doing well and have made it safely to my repo! I can't wait to share stuff that I find interesting and/or cool! This is presently for my Digital Humanities class at Pitt-Greensburg and who knows where we will end up! Catch you later!
